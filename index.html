   <h3> Syndromes and a Century (2006, Thailand) </h3> 
   <img src="syndr.jpg" alt="Syndromes and a Century" width="200" height="130">
   <p> Set 40 years ago in a small town's hospital, juxtaposed with a similar hospital in the present day. It is a fictional recollection of the love and work of the filmmaker's parents before they finally became lovers, exploring both memories and everyday lives in two eras where a painfully shy young man is courting Dr. Aroon (who is drawn instead to an orchid expert), and a young monk has an unexplained attraction to a dentist.

	<h3> California Dreamin' (2007, Romania)</h3>
	<img src="california.jpg" alt="California Dreamin" width="200" height="130">
	<p> Romanian director Cristian Nemescu's comedy California Dreamin' (aka Nesfarsit) unfolds against the backdrop of the Kosovo War, circa 1999. A NATO train rolls through a Romanian hamlet, transporting a plethora of weapons across the country -- without official documents, and equipped only with the verbal consent of the Romanian authorities. The transport thus grows intensely vulnerable to the locals -- particularly the corrupt head of the railway station, who moonlights as a mobster and promptly decides to interfere with the shipment.</p>

	 <h3>Schindler's list (1993, USA) </h3>
	 <img src="list.jpg" alt="Schindler's list" width="200" height="130">
	 <p> "Schindler's List" is described as a film about the Holocaust, but the Holocaust supplies the field for the story, rather than the subject. The film is really two parallel character studies--one of a con man, the other of a psychopath. Oskar Schindler, who swindles the Third Reich, and Amon Goeth, who represents its pure evil, are men created by the opportunities of war.</p>
